"""
Hash every original Space Engineers 2 game file and record the digests.

The result is a plain JSON object mapping each file's path (relative to the
game's SpaceEngineers2 folder, forward slashes on every platform) to the
lower-case hex SHA256 of its contents, sorted alphabetically by path and
written with 2-space indentation and LF line endings on every platform, so
every pair lands on its own line. That makes the file diffable: comparing two
game versions of it shows exactly which binaries changed, including the ones
that are neither assemblies nor copied into Data/Content.

The file lives in the skill's Data folder (~/.se2-dev/game-code), which is a
local Git repository, so each game version's hashes are committed alongside the
decompiled sources under the version label.

Modes:
    hash_game_files.py --write <GameRoot> <Data>
        Hash the game files and write <Data>/game_files.json.

    hash_game_files.py --verify <GameRoot> <Data>
        Re-hash the game files and compare them with <Data>/game_files.json.
        Exit codes:
            0 = every file matches the recorded hashes
            2 = files are missing, extra or modified
            1 = error (game root or hash file unusable)

Options:
    -j, --jobs N   Number of hashing threads (default: CPU count, max 16).
    -q, --quiet    Suppress progress reporting.

The game root is the folder holding Game2, GameData, etc. - not the Game2
folder itself.
