# Standalone Graphify health check.
#
# Usage: graphify_check.sh <graph-root> [--deep]
#
#   <graph-root>  Directory that was graphed, i.e. the one containing
#                 graphify-out/ (e.g. Data/Decompiled). Defaults to Data/Decompiled.
#   --deep        Also parse graphify-out/.graphify_analysis.json and confirm it
#                 holds a non-empty set of communities, i.e. clustering produced
#                 real content rather than an empty stub. Needs python3.
#
# To actually exercise queries against a prepared corpus, use that skill's
# test_graphify_*.sh script, which runs domain-specific query/explain/path calls.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  ok          - graph.json plus clustering data present (and usable with --deep)
#   2  missing     - no graph has been built yet
#   3  incomplete  - graph.json present but clustering is missing/interrupted;
#                    the graph must be cleaned and rebuilt from scratch
#
# On a non-zero result the graph is unusable and should be rebuilt. Rebuild is
# expensive for the decompiled game corpus (~10-30 minutes on the slow fallback),
# so confirm with the user before doing it.
