Each `se2-dev-*` prepare script can build a separate [Graphify](https://pypi.org/project/graphifyy/)
graph for the corpus it prepares. The graph is a navigable map (call/inherit/reference
edges plus LLM-named communities) beside the regular search indexes.

## Fast clustering vs. the slow fallback

Building a graph is cheap **except for clustering** (community detection), which is the
long pole on the big decompiled-game corpus. Graphify has two clustering backends:

- **Fast — native Rust Leiden** (`graspologic`, which needs **Python < 3.13**; we use
  3.12). Runs the whole game corpus in ~1-2 minutes.
- **Slow — pure-Python Louvain fallback**, used automatically when `graspologic` is not
  importable (e.g. Graphify installed on Python 3.13, where `graspologic` has no wheel).
  It is **single-core** and adds ~10-30 minutes on the ~220k-node game graph. On the small
  plugin-sources corpus it still finishes in seconds to a couple of minutes.

The skills' own `.venv` stays on Python 3.13; this Python 3.12 pin applies only to the
separately-installed `graphify` tool. Prepare defaults that tool to **Python 3.12 with the
`leiden` extra** and picks its behaviour from which backend is available:

- **Fast backend available** (Linux/Windows with `uv`): prepare **provisions it and builds
  the graph automatically** — no opt-in needed. Because `uv` can fetch Python 3.12 and the
  `graspologic` wheels on demand, this is the normal case.
- **Fast backend cannot be provisioned** (no `uv`, no Python 3.12, or `graspologic` will
  not import): Graphify stays **optional and off**. Prepare skips it and reports the time
  the slow fallback would cost; build anyway by opting in with `SE2_DEV_GRAPHIFY=1`.

`SE2_DEV_GRAPHIFY` is a tri-state override:

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| unset | **auto** — build when the fast Rust backend is available, skip otherwise |
| `1`   | **always build**, even on the slow single-core fallback (~10-30 min for game code) |
| `0`   | **never build** — disable Graphify entirely |

The one-time provisioning of the fast backend (uv fetching Python 3.12 + `graspologic`)
takes ~30-60 seconds and is logged. To pin a different interpreter, set
`SE2_DEV_GRAPHIFY_PYTHON` (default `3.12`); it must be `< 3.13` for the fast backend.

## Asking the user

On the fast path the graph builds automatically as part of prepare, so there is nothing to
ask — just mention it will be built.

Only when the fast backend is **unavailable** does the cost become significant, and only on
a large corpus. In that case the first time such a corpus is prepared the skill should **ask
the user whether to build the graph on the slow fallback**, stating the expected extra time
(see the [Build time](#build-time) table), and only opt in (`SE2_DEV_GRAPHIFY=1`) if they
agree. Skipping costs nothing later — it can be built on a subsequent prepare run at any
time.

## Installation

Prepare installs Graphify automatically through `uv` when the fast backend is available. To
install it manually, use the **fast** form (Python 3.12 + `leiden` extra):

```bash
# Recommended; uv fetches Python 3.12 and puts graphify on PATH automatically
uv tool install --python 3.12 'graphifyy[leiden]'

# Alternatives (the leiden extra is only fast on Python 3.12)
pipx install --python python3.12 'graphifyy[leiden]'
pip install 'graphifyy[leiden]'          # run under a Python 3.12 interpreter

# Then install Graphify integration for the active AI platform
graphify install --platform [AI PLATFORM]
```

Installing plain `graphifyy` (no `leiden` extra) or under Python 3.13 gets the slow
single-core clustering fallback.

Set `SE2_DEV_GRAPHIFY_PLATFORM` before prepare to run the platform install automatically
after the package is installed:

```bash
export SE2_DEV_GRAPHIFY_PLATFORM=codex     # Linux
```

```bat
set SE2_DEV_GRAPHIFY_PLATFORM=codex        REM Windows
```

## Graph roots

Prepare builds one graph per subskill, under that root's own `graphify-out/` directory:

| Subskill | Default graph root | Override |
|----------|--------------------|----------|
| `se2-dev-plugin` | downloaded plugin sources (`Data/Sources`) | `SE2_DEV_PLUGIN_PROJECT_ROOT` |
| `se2-dev-game-code` | decompiled game code (`Data/Decompiled`) | `SE2_DEV_GAME_CODE_GRAPH_ROOT` |

Use the override variables when the subskill should graph a specific active project
instead of the default prepared corpus.

## Build time

The Graphify step runs on top of the normal prepare time. Rough numbers:

- **First-ever install on a machine**: a one-time ~30-60 second provisioning (Graphify
  plus Python 3.12, the Rust `graspologic` clustering backend, tree-sitter and numpy).
- **First graph build** (`graphify <root>`): scales with corpus size; clustering dominates.
- **Later runs** (`graphify <root> --update`): incremental re-extraction of changed code
  files only, usually much faster; no LLM needed.

| Subskill | Corpus size | Added build time — fast (Rust Leiden) | Added build time — slow fallback |
|----------|-------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `se2-dev-plugin` | downloaded sources | seconds to ~1 min | seconds to a couple of minutes |
| `se2-dev-game-code` | ~10,000 decompiled `.cs` files (~220k-node graph) | ~1-2 minutes | ~10-30 minutes |

On the slow fallback the graph build for the decompiled game corpus can take as long as, or
longer than, the decompilation itself — which is why that path is opt-in. The fast Rust
backend removes that cost, so on a machine with `uv` the graph is built automatically.

## Disk space

The graph output is large: `graphify-out/` holds `graph.json`, the clustering analysis and
a semantic cache, and together they run roughly **9x the source corpus size**. For the
decompiled game code that is on the order of **1.5 GB**. The plugin-sources corpus is small
enough to be negligible.

On Windows, prepare runs a **disk pre-check** right before building: it requires roughly
`12 x corpus size + 1 GiB` of free space on the graph volume (headroom over the observed
footprint plus room for the code base to grow). If there is not enough free space it logs
how much is needed versus available and **skips the graph build** — core preparation
(decompilation and indexing) has already succeeded, so prepare still finishes. Free up
space and re-run prepare to build the graph later.

## Health check and rebuild

A graph is only usable once **clustering** finishes. Clustering writes
`graphify-out/.graphify_analysis.json`; without it every node has an empty community and
queries return little useful structure. A build that is killed part-way leaves a
`graph.json` with no clustering — an **incomplete, unusable** graph. (The fast backend makes
this far less likely, since clustering the big corpus now takes only a minute or two.)

Prepare guards against this automatically: it inspects an existing graph and, if it finds
`graph.json` but no clustering, it **cleans `graphify-out/` and rebuilds from scratch**
rather than `--update`-ing a broken graph.

To check a graph's health independently, run the standalone checker:

```bash
# Linux (from the subskill folder)
bash ../se2-dev/graphify_check.sh Data/Decompiled          # fast: file presence
bash ../se2-dev/graphify_check.sh Data/Decompiled --deep   # also validates clustering content
```

```bat
REM Windows
call ..\se2-dev\GraphifyCheck.bat Data\Decompiled
```

Pass `Data/Sources` instead when checking the `se2-dev-plugin` graph.

Exit codes: `0` ok, `2` missing (never built), `3` incomplete (must be rebuilt). If it
reports `incomplete` or `missing` and you want the graph, delete `graphify-out/` and re-run
prepare — it rebuilds automatically with the fast Rust backend. On a machine without that
backend the rebuild uses the slow fallback (~10-30 min for game code, quick for plugin
sources) and must be opted in with `SE2_DEV_GRAPHIFY=1`; **confirm with the user first** when
rebuilding the game-code graph that way.

## Corpus content and API keys

Graphify builds a **code-only** graph with no API key. It treats `.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`,
`.yaml`, `.yml`, `.html` and similar files as *documents* that need LLM-based semantic
extraction, and the build fails if any are present and no key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
`GEMINI_API_KEY`, …) is set. The decompiled game corpus is pure `.cs`/`.il` and builds
keyless, but mixed corpora do not — plugin repositories frequently ship a `README.md` and
other docs. To graph only the code in a mixed corpus without a key, add a `.graphifyignore`
(gitignore syntax) at the graph root (e.g. `Data/Sources/`) excluding the doc extensions.

## Failure behavior

Graphify is supplemental. Prepare logs a warning and continues if:

- Graphify is disabled (`SE2_DEV_GRAPHIFY=0`),
- the fast backend is unavailable and the user did not opt in (`SE2_DEV_GRAPHIFY` not `1`),
- the user declines installation on the slow-fallback path,
- `graphify` is not on `PATH` after installation,
- the selected graph root does not exist (e.g. no plugin sources downloaded yet),
- graph creation or update fails.

Core preparation still succeeds when its own steps (decompilation, registry download,
indexing) succeed.
